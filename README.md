# jobhuntr

## Inspiration

We were personally inspired to do this project due to our currently busy student schedules. We have to focus on schoolwork, but at the same time, we need to juggle internship interviews and studying algorithms and data structures for them. We needed a tool that can help us to make decisions quickly and efficiently while visualizing the best way to utilize our time. Thus, jobhuntr was born.

## What it does

jobhuntr is a platform where job seekers can track their job hunting process. They can learn insights about various cities as our platform collects more data about other job seekers and their job-seeking progress.

## How we built it

We built it using ReactJS/Javascript Frontend with a Python/(Many Data Science Libs) Backend. We chose this stack because ReactJS is a great choice for creating a performant frontend. We chose to use Python due to the wealth of data mining/processing libraries that processes data.

## Challenges we ran into

We were only two people, so we had a big project, but not a lot of resources to go around. We had to be efficient with our time, and we each had large responsibilities. Outside of this, we each also had our fair share of technical difficulties. Some of them being trouble with first-time use of libraries and bad data being plugged into our data-models.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud that we were able to persevere for 36 hours straight to create jobhuntr

## What we learned

We really learned a lot about our own capabilities, and obviously a lot more about the technologies that we used in the hackathon.

# What's next for jobhuntr

Hopefully, we can turn this product into a feasible business idea.
